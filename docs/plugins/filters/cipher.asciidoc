NOTE: This is a community-maintained plugin! It does not ship with Logstash by default, but it is easy to install by running `bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-cipher`.


This filter parses a source and apply a cipher or decipher before
storing it in the target.

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-filters-cipher-add_field]]
===== `add_field` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * Default value is `{}`

If this filter is successful, add any arbitrary fields to this event.
Field names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      cipher {
        add_field => { "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}" }
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also add multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      cipher {
        add_field => {
          "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}"
          "new_field" => "new_static_value"
        }
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add field `foo_hello` if it is present, with the
value above and the `%{host}` piece replaced with that value from the
event. The second example would also add a hardcoded field.

[[plugins-filters-cipher-add_tag]]
===== `add_tag` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, add arbitrary tags to the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      cipher {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also add multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      cipher {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "taggedy_tag"]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add a tag `foo_hello` (and the second example would of course add a `taggedy_tag` tag).

[[plugins-filters-cipher-algorithm]]
===== `algorithm` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The cipher algorithm

A list of supported algorithms can be obtained by
[source,ruby]
    puts OpenSSL::Cipher.ciphers

[[plugins-filters-cipher-base64]]
===== `base64` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `true`

Do we have to perform a `base64` decode or encode?

If we are decrypting, `base64` decode will be done before.
If we are encrypting, `base64` will be done after.


[[plugins-filters-cipher-cipher_padding]]
===== `cipher_padding` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Cipher padding to use. Enables or disables padding.

By default encryption operations are padded using standard block padding
and the padding is checked and removed when decrypting. If the pad
parameter is zero then no padding is performed, the total amount of data
encrypted or decrypted must then be a multiple of the block size or an
error will occur.

See EVP_CIPHER_CTX_set_padding for further information.

We are using Openssl jRuby which uses default padding to PKCS5Padding
If you want to change it, set this parameter. If you want to disable
it, Set this parameter to 0
[source,ruby]
    filter { cipher { cipher_padding => 0 }}

[[plugins-filters-cipher-iv]]
===== `iv`  (DEPRECATED)

  * DEPRECATED WARNING: This configuration item is deprecated and may not be available in future versions.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The initialization vector to use (statically hard-coded). For
a random IV see the iv_random_length property

NOTE: If iv_random_length is set, it takes precedence over any value set for "iv"

The cipher modes CBC, CFB, OFB and CTR all need an "initialization
vector", or short, IV. ECB mode is the only mode that does not require
an IV, but there is almost no legitimate use case for this mode
because of the fact that it does not sufficiently hide plaintext patterns.

For AES algorithms set this to a 16 byte string.
[source,ruby]
    filter { cipher { iv => "1234567890123456" }}

Deprecated: Please use `iv_random_length` instead

[[plugins-filters-cipher-iv_random_length]]
===== `iv_random_length` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Force an random IV to be used per encryption invocation and specify
the length of the random IV that will be generated via:

      OpenSSL::Random.random_bytes(int_length)

If iv_random_length is set, it takes precedence over any value set for "iv"

Enabling this will force the plugin to generate a unique
random IV for each encryption call. This random IV will be prepended to the
encrypted result bytes and then base64 encoded. On decryption "iv_random_length" must
also be set to utilize this feature. Random IV's are better than statically
hardcoded IVs

For AES algorithms you can set this to a 16
[source,ruby]
    filter { cipher { iv_random_length => 16 }}

[[plugins-filters-cipher-key]]
===== `key` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The key to use

NOTE: If you encounter an error message at runtime containing the following:

"java.security.InvalidKeyException: Illegal key size: possibly you need to install 
Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) Unlimited Strength Jurisdiction Policy Files for your JRE"

Please read the following: https://github.com/jruby/jruby/wiki/UnlimitedStrengthCrypto


[[plugins-filters-cipher-key_pad]]
===== `key_pad` 

  <li> Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"\u0000"`

The character used to pad the key

[[plugins-filters-cipher-key_size]]
===== `key_size` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `16`

The key size to pad

It depends of the cipher algorithm. If your key doesn't need
padding, don't set this parameter

Example, for AES-128, we must have 16 char long key. AES-256 = 32 chars 
[source,ruby]
    filter { cipher { key_size => 16 }


[[plugins-filters-cipher-max_cipher_reuse]]
===== `max_cipher_reuse` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1`

If this is set the internal Cipher instance will be
re-used up to @max_cipher_reuse times before being
reset() and re-created from scratch. This is an option
for efficiency where lots of data is being encrypted
and decrypted using this filter. This lets the filter
avoid creating new Cipher instances over and over
for each encrypt/decrypt operation.

This is optional, the default is no re-use of the Cipher
instance and max_cipher_reuse = 1 by default
[source,ruby]
    filter { cipher { max_cipher_reuse => 1000 }}

[[plugins-filters-cipher-mode]]
===== `mode` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Encrypting or decrypting some data

Valid values are encrypt or decrypt

[[plugins-filters-cipher-periodic_flush]]
===== `periodic_flush` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Call the filter flush method at regular interval.
Optional.

[[plugins-filters-cipher-remove_field]]
===== `remove_field` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary fields from this event.
Fields names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      cipher {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also remove multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      cipher {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "my_extraneous_field" ]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the field with name `foo_hello` if it is present. The second
example would remove an additional, non-dynamic field.

[[plugins-filters-cipher-remove_tag]]
===== `remove_tag` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary tags from the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      cipher {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also remove multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      cipher {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "sad_unwanted_tag"]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the tag `foo_hello` if it is present. The second example
would remove a sad, unwanted tag as well.

[[plugins-filters-cipher-source]]
===== `source` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"message"`

The field to perform filter

Example, to use the @message field (default) :
[source,ruby]
    filter { cipher { source => "message" } }

[[plugins-filters-cipher-target]]
===== `target` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"message"`

The name of the container to put the result

Example, to place the result into crypt :
[source,ruby]
    filter { cipher { target => "crypt" } }
