[[plugins-filters-ruby]]
=== ruby



Execute ruby code.

For example, to cancel 90% of events, you can do this:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      ruby {
        # Cancel 90% of events
        code => "event.cancel if rand <= 0.90"
      }
    }

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-filters-ruby-add_field]]
===== `add_field` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * Default value is `{}`

If this filter is successful, add any arbitrary fields to this event.
Field names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      ruby {
        add_field => { "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}" }
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also add multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      ruby {
        add_field => {
          "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}"
          "new_field" => "new_static_value"
        }
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add field `foo_hello` if it is present, with the
value above and the `%{host}` piece replaced with that value from the
event. The second example would also add a hardcoded field.

[[plugins-filters-ruby-add_tag]]
===== `add_tag` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, add arbitrary tags to the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      ruby {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also add multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      ruby {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "taggedy_tag"]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add a tag `foo_hello` (and the second example would of course add a `taggedy_tag` tag).

[[plugins-filters-ruby-code]]
===== `code` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The code to execute for every event.
You will have an `event` variable available that is the event itself.

[[plugins-filters-ruby-init]]
===== `init` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Any code to execute at logstash startup-time

[[plugins-filters-ruby-periodic_flush]]
===== `periodic_flush` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Call the filter flush method at regular interval.
Optional.

[[plugins-filters-ruby-remove_field]]
===== `remove_field` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary fields from this event.
Fields names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      ruby {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also remove multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      ruby {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "my_extraneous_field" ]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the field with name `foo_hello` if it is present. The second
example would remove an additional, non-dynamic field.

[[plugins-filters-ruby-remove_tag]]
===== `remove_tag` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary tags from the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      ruby {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also remove multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      ruby {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "sad_unwanted_tag"]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the tag `foo_hello` if it is present. The second example
would remove a sad, unwanted tag as well.
