=== punct


NOTE: This is a community-maintained plugin! It does not ship with Logstash by default, but it is easy to install by running `bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-filter-punct`.


Strip everything but punctuation from a field and store the remainder in the
a separate field. This is often used for fingerprinting log events.

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-filters-punct-add_field]]
===== `add_field` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * Default value is `{}`

If this filter is successful, add any arbitrary fields to this event.
Field names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      punct {
        add_field => { "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}" }
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also add multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      punct {
        add_field => {
          "foo_%{somefield}" => "Hello world, from %{host}"
          "new_field" => "new_static_value"
        }
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add field `foo_hello` if it is present, with the
value above and the `%{host}` piece replaced with that value from the
event. The second example would also add a hardcoded field.

[[plugins-filters-punct-add_tag]]
===== `add_tag` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, add arbitrary tags to the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      punct {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also add multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      punct {
        add_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "taggedy_tag"]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would add a tag `foo_hello` (and the second example would of course add a `taggedy_tag` tag).

[[plugins-filters-punct-periodic_flush]]
===== `periodic_flush` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Call the filter flush method at regular interval.
Optional.

[[plugins-filters-punct-remove_field]]
===== `remove_field` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary fields from this event.
Fields names can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the %{field}
Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      punct {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also remove multiple fields at once:
    filter {
      punct {
        remove_field => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "my_extraneous_field" ]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the field with name `foo_hello` if it is present. The second
example would remove an additional, non-dynamic field.

[[plugins-filters-punct-remove_tag]]
===== `remove_tag` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * Default value is `[]`

If this filter is successful, remove arbitrary tags from the event.
Tags can be dynamic and include parts of the event using the `%{field}`
syntax.

Example:
[source,ruby]
    filter {
      punct {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}" ]
      }
    }
[source,ruby]
    # You can also remove multiple tags at once:
    filter {
      punct {
        remove_tag => [ "foo_%{somefield}", "sad_unwanted_tag"]
      }
    }

If the event has field `"somefield" == "hello"` this filter, on success,
would remove the tag `foo_hello` if it is present. The second example
would remove a sad, unwanted tag as well.

[[plugins-filters-punct-source]]
===== `source` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"message"`

The field reference to use for punctuation stripping

[[plugins-filters-punct-target]]
===== `target` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"punct"`

The field to store the result.
