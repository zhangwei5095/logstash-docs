=== avro


NOTE: This is a community-maintained plugin! It does not ship with Logstash by default, but it is easy to install by running `bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-codec-avro`.


Read serialized Avro records as Logstash events

This plugin is used to serialize Logstash events as 
Avro datums, as well as deserializing Avro datums into 
Logstash events.

==== Encoding

This codec is for serializing individual Logstash events 
as Avro datums that are Avro binary blobs. It does not encode 
Logstash events into an Avro file.


==== Decoding

This codec is for deserializing individual Avro records. It is not for reading
Avro files. Avro files have a unique format that must be handled upon input.


==== Usage
Example usage with Kafka input.

[source,ruby]
----------------------------------
input {
  kafka {
    codec => {
      avro => {
        schema_uri => "/tmp/schema.avsc"
      }
    }
  }
}
filter {
  ...
}
output {
  ...
}
