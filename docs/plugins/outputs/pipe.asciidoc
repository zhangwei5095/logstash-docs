==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-outputs-pipe-codec]]
===== `codec` 

  * Value type is <<codec,codec>>
  * Default value is `"plain"`

The codec used for output data. Output codecs are a convenient method for encoding your data before it leaves the output, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

[[plugins-outputs-pipe-command]]
===== `command` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Command line to launch and pipe to

[[plugins-outputs-pipe-message_format]]
===== `message_format` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The format to use when writing events to the pipe. This value
supports any string and can include `%{name}` and other dynamic
strings.

If this setting is omitted, the full json representation of the
event will be written as a single line.

[[plugins-outputs-pipe-ttl]]
===== `ttl` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `10`

Close pipe that hasn't been used for TTL seconds. -1 or 0 means never close.

[[plugins-outputs-pipe-workers]]
===== `workers` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1`

The number of workers to use for this output.
Note that this setting may not be useful for all outputs.
