==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-outputs-lumberjack-codec]]
===== `codec` 

  * Value type is <<codec,codec>>
  * Default value is `"plain"`

The codec used for output data. Output codecs are a convenient method for encoding your data before it leaves the output, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

[[plugins-outputs-lumberjack-flush_size]]
===== `flush_size` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1024`

To make efficient calls to the lumberjack output we are buffering events locally.
if the number of events exceed the number the declared `flush_size` we will
send them to the logstash server.

[[plugins-outputs-lumberjack-hosts]]
===== `hosts` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

list of addresses lumberjack can send to

[[plugins-outputs-lumberjack-idle_flush_time]]
===== `idle_flush_time` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1`

The amount of time since last flush before a flush is forced.

This setting helps ensure slow event rates don't get stuck in Logstash.
For example, if your `flush_size` is 100, and you have received 10 events,
and it has been more than `idle_flush_time` seconds since the last flush,
Logstash will flush those 10 events automatically.

This helps keep both fast and slow log streams moving along in
near-real-time.

[[plugins-outputs-lumberjack-port]]
===== `port` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.
