=== metriccatcher


NOTE: This is a community-maintained plugin! It does not ship with Logstash by default, but it is easy to install by running `bin/logstash-plugin install logstash-output-metriccatcher`.


This output ships metrics to MetricCatcher, allowing you to
utilize Coda Hale's Metrics.

More info on MetricCatcher: https://github.com/clearspring/MetricCatcher

At Clearspring, we use it to count the response codes from Apache logs:
[source,ruby]
    metriccatcher {
        host => "localhost"
        port => "1420"
        type => "apache-access"
        fields => [ "response" ]
        meter => {
            "%{host}.apache.response.%{response}" => "1"
            }
    }

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-biased]]
===== `biased` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The metrics to send. This supports dynamic strings like `%{host}`
for metric names and also for values. This is a hash field with key
of the metric name, value of the metric value.

The value will be coerced to a floating point value. Values which cannot be
coerced will zero (0)

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-codec]]
===== `codec` 

  * Value type is <<codec,codec>>
  * Default value is `"plain"`

The codec used for output data. Output codecs are a convenient method for encoding your data before it leaves the output, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-counter]]
===== `counter` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The metrics to send. This supports dynamic strings like `%{host}`
for metric names and also for values. This is a hash field with key
of the metric name, value of the metric value. Example:
[source,ruby]
  counter => { "%{host}.apache.hits.%{response} => "1" }

The value will be coerced to a floating point value. Values which cannot be
coerced will zero (0)

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-gauge]]
===== `gauge` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The metrics to send. This supports dynamic strings like `%{host}`
for metric names and also for values. This is a hash field with key
of the metric name, value of the metric value.

The value will be coerced to a floating point value. Values which cannot be
coerced will zero (0)

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-host]]
===== `host` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * Default value is `"localhost"`

The address of the MetricCatcher

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-meter]]
===== `meter` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The metrics to send. This supports dynamic strings like `%{host}`
for metric names and also for values. This is a hash field with key
of the metric name, value of the metric value.

The value will be coerced to a floating point value. Values which cannot be
coerced will zero (0)

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-port]]
===== `port` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1420`

The port to connect on your MetricCatcher

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-timer]]
===== `timer` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The metrics to send. This supports dynamic strings like %{host}
for metric names and also for values. This is a hash field with key
of the metric name, value of the metric value. Example:
[source,ruby]
  timer => { "%{host}.apache.response_time => "%{response_time}" }

The value will be coerced to a floating point value. Values which cannot be
coerced will zero (0)

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-uniform]]
===== `uniform` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

The metrics to send. This supports dynamic strings like `%{host}`
for metric names and also for values. This is a hash field with key
of the metric name, value of the metric value.

The value will be coerced to a floating point value. Values which cannot be
coerced will zero (0)

[[plugins-outputs-metriccatcher-workers]]
===== `workers` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `1`

The number of workers to use for this output.
Note that this setting may not be useful for all outputs.
