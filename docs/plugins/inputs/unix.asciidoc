[[plugins-inputs-unix]]
=== unix

NOTE: This is a community-maintained plugin!

Read events over a UNIX socket.

Like `stdin` and `file` inputs, each event is assumed to be one line of text.

Can either accept connections from clients or connect to a server,
depending on `mode`.

==== Details

&nbsp;

[[plugins-inputs-unix-add_field]]
===== `add_field` 

  * Value type is <<hash,hash>>
  * Default value is `{}`

Add a field to an event

[[plugins-inputs-unix-codec]]
===== `codec` 

  * Value type is <<codec,codec>>
  * Default value is `"line"`

The codec used for input data. Input codecs are a convenient method for decoding your data before it enters the input, without needing a separate filter in your Logstash pipeline.

[[plugins-inputs-unix-data_timeout]]
===== `data_timeout` 

  * Value type is <<number,number>>
  * Default value is `-1`

The 'read' timeout in seconds. If a particular connection is idle for
more than this timeout period, we will assume it is dead and close it.

If you never want to timeout, use -1.

[[plugins-inputs-unix-force_unlink]]
===== `force_unlink` 

  * Value type is <<boolean,boolean>>
  * Default value is `false`

Remove socket file in case of EADDRINUSE failure

[[plugins-inputs-unix-mode]]
===== `mode` 

  * Value can be any of: `server`, `client`
  * Default value is `"server"`

Mode to operate in. `server` listens for client connections,
`client` connects to a server.

[[plugins-inputs-unix-path]]
===== `path` 

  * This is a required setting.
  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

When mode is `server`, the path to listen on.
When mode is `client`, the path to connect to.

[[plugins-inputs-unix-tags]]
===== `tags` 

  * Value type is <<array,array>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Add any number of arbitrary tags to your event.

This can help with processing later.

[[plugins-inputs-unix-type]]
===== `type` 

  * Value type is <<string,string>>
  * There is no default value for this setting.

Add a `type` field to all events handled by this input.

Types are used mainly for filter activation.

The type is stored as part of the event itself, so you can
also use the type to search for it in Kibana.

If you try to set a type on an event that already has one (for
example when you send an event from a shipper to an indexer) then
a new input will not override the existing type. A type set at
the shipper stays with that event for its life even
when sent to another Logstash server.
